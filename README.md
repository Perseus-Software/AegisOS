# Pallas Linux
Pallas is a extremly minimal linux distribution (So minimal it doesn't even have a logo) based on LFS containing on a few components

The base system will only have the following software (This is only default you can always add or remove more)
- xorg (With IceWM)
- gcc
- xterm
- bash
- nano
- runit
That is all I can think of for now may add more later :3
